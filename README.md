A 1.12.2 modpack with 400+ mods!

## When will this pack be finished?
In order for Generality to be officially complete, there must be...

  * Zero known bugs left unfixed.
  * No duplicate recipes, items, or features.
  * Very rare crashes, none if possible.
  * At least 30 custom music discs.
  * Extensive searching for bugs and unintended game mechanics completed.
  * Fully customized loot tables that are different for every structure.
  * At least 20 custom planets for Advanced Rocketry.
  * Custom mods made by me or someone else for the pack. <sub><sup>(Yes I need modders, you can dm me if you want to help out.)</sup></sub>
  * An extremely refined modlist with a severe lack of unnecessary mods.
  * Many, many, many tweaks to certain features and items.


## Can I report bugs and/or issues?
Yes!  Just include a screenshot when needed :)
